              Sahib Ji, is situated at an altitude of around 4,329 m, on the
              bank of the pristine Hemkund Lake. One of the most revered Sikh
              shrines, Hemkunt Sahib (also known as Hemkund Sahib) draws

              earlier births. Surrounded by snow-capped peaks, the gurudwara's

              the epic Ramayana, regained his health by meditating on the banks
              of Hemkund after the severe injuries he received in the war. The

              Originating from the Nar Narayan Peak of Himalayas at 400 ft,
              Vasundhara Falls is a waterfall located in Mana Village, 9km from
              Badrinath. The fall meets with the Alaknanda river at an altitude
              of 12,000 feet. It is believed to have been the resting place of
              the Pandavas. People also believe that the waterfalls turn away
              from visitors impure in thoughts and heart. Vasundhra Falls can be
              reached by trekking for 6km. The first 3km from Badrinath to Mana
              Village is a motorable road and can be reached by taxi while the
              remaining 6km is a walkable trek of around 2 hours. The trek
              becomes little difficult after passing Saraswati Mandir in the
              Mana Village. The views of the Vasundhara River Valley during the
              trek is breathtaking.It's a 300 km drive from Dehradun airport to
              Mana village. You may drive to Rudraparayag via Rishikeshthe first
              day and then drive to Govindghat or Badrinath the second day.
              Badrinath is just 32 km from Govindghat. Drive another 3kms to
              reach Mana Village, the last motorable point. The roads to Mana
              are open only when Badrinath season starts in May. The rest of the
              time they are snow laid and close.
