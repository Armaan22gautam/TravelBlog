            Lawe Dhura, and Belcha, Pithoragarh is the last district adjoining Tibet.

            Pithoragarh Fort, also known as London Fort, is a symbol of the
            town's historical significance. Nestled in the picturesque hill
            town of Pithoragarh in Uttarakhand, India, this fort holds a commanding
            position atop a hill providing splendid views of the surrounding Kumaon
            hills and small townships. Built by the Gorkhas in 1789 when they captured
            the town, the fort was later taken over by the British in 1815. The structure
            exhibits the typical architectural style of the era, with sturdy walls and bastions
            designed for defense. The fort's presence speaks volumes about the strategic importance
            of Pithoragarh as a gateway to the Himalayas, lying on the northern frontier of British
            India. Today, the fort is mostly in ruins; however, it continues to attract history enthusiasts
            and travelers alike who come to witness the legacy of the past amidst the natural beauty.
            The panoramic views of the valley and the town from the fort are truly breathtaking, and
            on a clear day, one can see the distant peaks of the snow-clad Himalayas.So its a place 
            not to miss if you travel towards Pithoragarh.
