          Lying on the southern slopes of outer Himalayas, Tehri Garhwal is on
          of the sacred hilly districts of Uttarakhand State. Before the
          creation of universe, Lord Brahma is said to have meditated on this
          sacred land. Muni-ki-Reti and Tapovan of the district are the places
          of penance for the ancient Rishis. Its hilly terrain and lack of easy
          communications have helped it to preserve its culture almost intact.
          Tehri and Garhwal are the two words combined for naming the district
          as Tehri Garhwal. While the prefix Tehri is the corrupted form of the
          word Trihari` which signifies a place that washes away all the three
          types of sins, namely sins born out of thought (Mansa), word (Vacha)
          and deed (Karmana), the other part `Garh` means country fort. In fact
          during olden days possession of number of forts was considered as a
          significant measuring rod of the prosperity and power of their rulers.
          Prior to 888, the whole of the Garhwal region was divided into small
          `garhs` ruled by separate independent kings known as Rana, Rai or
          Thakur. It is said that the prince Kanakpal who hailed from Malwa
          visited Badrinath ji (presently in Chamoli district) where he met the
          then mightiest king Bhanu Pratap. King Bhanu Pratap was impressed with
          the prince and got his only daughter married to him and also handed
          over his kingdom. Gradually Kanakpal and his descendents extended
          their empire by conquering all the garhs. Thus up to 1803 i.e. for 915
          years the whole of the Garhwal region remained under their control.The
          best time to visit Therigarhwal is typically during the spring and
          autumn seasons. The spring months of March to May offer mild
          temperatures, lush greenery, and the chance to witness the vibrant
          blooming of wildflowers. The autumn months of September to November,
          on the other hand, present clear skies, crisp air, and stunning fall
          foliage that paints the landscape in a mesmerizing array of colors.
          During the spring, visitors can explore the region's numerous
          high-altitude meadows, locally known as "bugyals," where they can
          witness the stunning display of colorful alpine flowers. These meadows
          are also home to a diverse array of birdlife, making it a paradise for
          avid bird watchers. The region's numerous glacial lakes, such as the
          picturesque Satopanth and Bhagirathi lakes, offer breathtaking views
          and opportunities for trekking and camping.
